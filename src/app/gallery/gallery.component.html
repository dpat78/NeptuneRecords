      <p class="product-item-text">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the most important rock & roll album ever made, an unsurpassed adventure in
        concept, sound, songwriting, cover art and studio technology by the greatest rock & roll group of all time.</p>

      <p class="product-item-text">Recorded in a staggering six days, Highway 61 Revisited – named after the road that runs from Bob Dylan's home state
        of Minnesota down through the Mississippi Delta – is one of those albums that changed everything.</p>

      <p class="product-item-text">Pete Townshend said he suffered a nervous breakdown when his planned follow-up to the rock opera Tommy, the ambitious,
        theatrical Lifehouse, fell apart. But he was left with an extraordinary cache of songs that the Who honed for what
        became their best studio album, Who's Next. "Won't Get Fooled Again," "Bargain" and "Baba O'Riley" (named in tribute
        to avant-garde composer Terry Riley and Townshend's spiritual guru Meher Baba) all beam with epic majesty, often
        spiked with synthesizers.</p>

      <p class="product-item-text">Also known as the "primal scream" album, referring to the painful therapy that gave rise to its songs, Plastic Ono
        Band was John Lennon's first proper solo album and rock & roll's most self-revelatory recording. Lennon attacks and
        ­denies idols and icons, including his own former band ("I don't believe in Beatles," he sings in "God"), to hit
        a pure, raw core of confession that, in its echo-drenched, garage-rock crudity, is years ahead of punk.</p>

      <p class="product-item-text">Year: 1972 <br>SKU: 4412309</p>
      <p class="product-item-text">This album documents one of the most elaborate self-mythologizing schemes in rock, as David Bowie created the glittery,
        messianic alter ego Ziggy Stardust ("well-hung and snow-white tan"). The glam rock Bowie made with guitarist Mick
        Ronson on tracks like "Hang on to Yourself" and "Suffragette City" is an irresistible blend of sexy, campy pop and
        blues power. The anthem "Ziggy Stardust" is one of rock's earliest, and best, power ballads.</p>

      <p class="product-item-text">This is what Britain sounded like in late 1966 and early 1967: ablaze with rainbow blues, orchestral guitar feedback

      <p class="product-item-text">Incredibly, it took more than 20 years for Presley's Sun output to be properly collected on a 1976 LP – which has since
        been superseded by this 1999 double-CD chronicle of the King's beginnings at Sun. It collects everything he cut at
        the studio, including alternate takes and the 1953 acetate he recorded as a gift for his mother as a shy and awkward
        recent high school graduate.</p>

      <p class="product-item-text">On their first album, Led Zeppelin were still in the process of inventing their own sound, moving on from the heavy
        rave-ups of guitarist Jimmy Page's previous band, the Yardbirds. But from the beginning, Zeppelin had the astonishing
        fusion of Page's lyrical guitar-playing, Robert Plant's paint-peeling love-hound yowl, and John Paul Jones and John
        Bonham's avalanche boogie.</p>
